  <h1>Understanding the Difference Between Document and Window Objects in JavaScript</h1>

  <p>
    In JavaScript, the Document and Window objects are crucial components of the Document Object Model (DOM),
    which represents the web page as a structured tree of objects.
    Both objects play significant roles in manipulating and interacting with the web page and its content,
    but they serve distinct purposes.
    In this blog, we'll delve into the differences between the Document and Window objects and explore their functionalities.
  </p>

  <h2>The Document Object</h2>
  <p>
    The Document object represents the HTML document loaded in the web browser.
    It serves as an interface to access and modify the content and elements of the web page.
    The Document object provides methods and properties to interact with individual elements, change the document's structure,
    and respond to events. Here are some key aspects of the Document object:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Accessing Elements:</strong> The Document object provides methods like <b>getElementById</b>,
      <b>getElementsByTagName</b>, and <b>getElementsByClassName</b> to access elements within the web page's DOM.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Manipulating Content:</strong> You can use the Document object to add or remove elements,
      modify their content, or change their attributes dynamically.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Event Handling:</strong> The Document object enables event handling, allowing you to listen for and respond to various events
      such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Forms and Input Elements:</strong> The Document object allows you to access and interact with form elements,
      including reading and setting their values.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Window Object</h2>
  <p>
    The Window object represents the web browser's window or tab that displays the HTML document.
    It serves as the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment and provides access to various properties
    and methods related to the window and its interaction with the user. Here are some key aspects of the Window object:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables and functions declared in the top-level context of a web page become properties
      and methods of the Window object. This makes the Window object the global scope for JavaScript running in that page.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Navigation and Location:</strong> The Window object allows you to control the browser's navigation,
      such as opening new windows or tabs, reloading the page, and changing the URL of the current page.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Timers and Intervals:</strong> The Window object provides methods like <b>setTimeout</b> and <b>setInterval</b>
      to schedule the execution of functions after specified time intervals.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Browser Properties:</strong> The Window object offers access to various browser properties, such as the inner width and height
      of the browser window, screen resolution, and history.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Alerts and Dialogs:</strong> The Window object enables you to display alerts, confirmations, and prompts to interact with the user.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Differences</h2>
  <p>
    While both the Document and Window objects are crucial in web development, they serve different purposes:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Context:</strong> The Document object represents the web page's content and structure, while the Window object represents
      the browser window or tab displaying the page.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Variables and functions declared in the top-level context of a web page are properties and methods
      of the Window object, providing a global scope accessible across scripts.
    </li><br>
    <li><strong>Functionality:</strong> The Document object focuses on accessing and manipulating the content of the web page,
      whereas the Window object deals with browser-level interactions, navigation, and controlling the window's behavior.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In conclusion, the Document and Window objects are essential components of the DOM and JavaScript's browser environment,
    each serving unique roles in manipulating and interacting with web pages.
    Understanding the differences between these objects helps developers effectively harness their functionalities
    and create dynamic and responsive web applications.
